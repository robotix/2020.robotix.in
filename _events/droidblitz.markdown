###Problem Statement

To build a remote controlled electric-powered robot that can be used to complete broken pathways and transfer packages by running on land as well as water.

###USP

- Amphibious robot
- Coordination between two robots

###Task

* Build a robot/a pair of robots that can be used to perform tasks on land and water.

* Complete broken pathways by placing blocks kept on land in the given slots.

###Robot specification

* Participants can bring two separate robots one that travels on land and one that moves on water or they can bring a single amphibious robot that can travel both on land as well as water.

* The robots must be electric powered and wireless (remote controlled).

* A pair of receiver and transmitter (Rx and Tx) will be provided by organizers, on prior request of the participants. The Tx-Rx pair has 4 channels. It can be used to control a maximum of 3 servomotors. Participants who wish to use Rx and Tx provided by us, will have to make provision for this receiver on their robot. The participants can bring their own set of Rx and Tx if they want.

###General Rules

* Maximum number of participants allowed per team:** 5 people.**

* The participants will be provided with **220 Volts, 50 Hz** standard AC supply.

* Participants will have to arrange for any other power supply required for their robot.

* Teams cannot tinker with their bots during the run.

* LEGO kits or its spare parts or pre-made mechanical parts are not allowed.[ (](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms)

* The decision of the organising team will be final and binding.

* **No submissions prior to the event are required.**

###Event Rules

* The participants can use any suitable mechanism for water, land traversal and for their amphibious robots.

* The team that brings two separate robots for land and water traversal can operate only one robot at a time.

* The robot will not be allowed to move ahead without completing the path.

* During the one on one round obstructing the motion of other teams robot will be penalised by disqualification.

* Robot has to move in specified channels and bumping into the arena will be penalised with negative points.

####Round 1

**Arena Image:**

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/event/droidblitz/image_0.png){:class="img-responsive"}

**Arena Description:**

* The arena has 2 zones a water and a land zone.

* There are 2 blocks, 3 green coloured and 1 violet.

* There are 3 red coloured voids in the arena.

* The green blocks are to be placed in the red coloured voids.

* The violet block is to be carried across the channel and placed on the violet coloured zone in water.

*  The green coloured zone in water is the end zone.

**Arena Dimensions:**

* Width of the land and water zone both are 100cm.

* Green coloured blocks are 4cm x 4cm x 3cm (lxbxh).

*  The red voids are 6cm x 6cm x 3cm (lxbxh).

* The violet block is 6cm x 6cm x 6cm in dimension.

**Task:**

* Time and points based round.

* The robot running on land has to pick up green coloured objects (on land) and complete its path (bridge) by placing the objects in red coloured slots on the arena.

* On reaching the end of the land zone it has to pick up the violet package and place it on the robot in water.

* The robot in water has to follow the specified path and deliver the package at the violet deposit zone.

* The robot has to move around the blockade in the channel and then reach the green end zone to finish the round.

* If the participant brings a robot capable of traversing on both land and water he can complete the bridge and at the same time pick up the package and deliver it across the water while following the specified path to complete the round successfully.

**Round rules:**

* Maximum time: **3** minutes.

* Maximum number of Time-outs allowed :1(1 min)

* Restarts allowed : 1
NOTE: Restarts will be given only for **technical fault** in the bot.

**Scoring Formula:**

* Picking object on land: +25 points

* Placing object in the slot: +50 points

* Reaching end point on the land: +50 points

* Picking up the package: +25 points

* Placing package in the deposit zone: +75 points

* Reaching end point on water: +50 points

* Time Bonus: +(Time Left x 2)

* Package falls into water: -25 points

* Bumping into the arena: -25 points

* Restart: -100 points

* Timeout: -50 points

####Round 2

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/event/droidblitz/image_2.png){:class="img-responsive"}

**Arena Description:**

* The arena has 2 zones a water and a land zone.

* This will be a one on one round and there are two different arenas for both the teams.(The thin wall separates the arena)

* The teams have to deposit the 4 blocks in 4 different zones in the arena.

* The blue coloured zone is the deposit zone for the blocks.

* All the blocks have to be placed on the blue before moving them in the deposit zones in water.

**Arena Dimensions:**

* All the blocks are 6cm x 6cm x 6m (lxbxh).

* The deposit strip is 15cm in width.

* The water zone is 200cm x 150cm in dimension.

**Task:**

* Coordination round.

* Two teams one on one (knock-out round).

* First team to complete all the tasks or the team with most points at the end of the specified time limit wins.

*  The teams have to pick up blocks kept on land and place it on specified zones near water.

* All the blocks on land have to be placed first before starting the tasks in water.

* The team that has a separate land and water can move only one robot at a time the other has to remain stationary.

* Note: Multiple blocks can be picked at once.

* Once all the blocks are placed near water the robots have to enter into water and pickup those blocks, navigate through water channels and place them at the specified locations on water.

* After placing all the blocks the robot has to reach the end zone in water.

**Round rules:**

* Maximum time: **4** minutes.

* Number of objects: 4

* Maximum number of Time-outs allowed :2(1 min)

* Restarts allowed : 1

NOTE: Restarts will be given only for **technical fault** in the bot.

**Scoring Formula:**

* Picking up an object on land: +25 points

* Placing an object in deposit zone on land: +50 points

* Placing a package in the deposit zone on water: +75 points

* Reaching end point on water: +50 points

* Package falls into water: -25 points

* Bumping into the arena: -25 points

* Restart: -100 points

* Timeout: -50 points
