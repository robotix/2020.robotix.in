###Introduction
Google’s successful Ground Truth project allowed them to extract data from road signs using satellite and on-ground imagery. Here’s a chance to solve that very problem at the ground level with Surprisingly Helpful Equation Linked Differential Optimised Numerator (S.H.E.L.D.O.N.) Imagine if all those road signs could be used by an autonomous vehicle to navigate in the unknown environment. That’s exactly what this event is all about, building a robot which can intelligently track characters spread out in a region using image processing, deciphering the puzzle and thus arriving at a meaningful expression.

###USP

- Equation Solving
- Alphanumeric Character Recognition
- Object and Position Tracker
- Algorithm Development

###Problem Statement

Build an image processing robot capable of detecting characters, using an overhead camera and traversing them such that the expression / equation generated by the traversal fulfills a certain condition.

###Task

- The program has to detect the characters using an overhead camera, and display their positions individually. 
- It has to then traverse the characters in such a way that an arithmetic logical equation is generated. For traversal a marker will be provided to be stuck on the robot.
- For uniqueness the output of the arithmetic logical equation generated should satisfy a certain condition.

###Arena

- Green Zone: Start Zone
- Red Zone: End Zone
- Black Squares: Numbers or characters representing operands/operators respectively

####Logical Arithmetic Equation

- Only one arithmetic operator should be present between any two operands (**this is only true for Round 1**). Arithmetic operators which will be used: 
    - Addition:  **+** 
    - Subtraction:  **-** 
    - Multiplication:  **x** 
    - Division:  **/**
    - Factorial:  **!** 
    - Exponentiation:  **^**
    - Equals:  **=** 
    - Parenthesis:  **( )**
- Precedence of operators are in the order of:
    - Parenthesis
    - Factorial 
    - Exponentiation
    - Multiplication and Division 
    - Addition and Subtraction
- Limit on the number of usage of operators and numbers will vary according to each round.

####Specifications

- Arena will be a real arena with dimensions 3m x 3m. Background of the arena will be white.
- The arena will have a green coloured start zone. Initially the robot will begin from here.
- The arena will also have a red coloured end zone where the robot needs to go after generating the desired equation.
- Numbers and operators will be pasted on squares of size 20cm x 20cm which will be present in the arena. The top facing side of these squares will be black while the characters printed on it will be in white. The font of the characters will be ‘Arial’.
- In order to show that the robot has successfully detected a number or an operator, it has traverse on top the respective square and flash a red L.E.D. for 2 seconds.
- Tracker to be attached to the robot will have two squares of colours orange and pink.
- A sketch of the character on the arena is provided below. These are to be considered only for illustration purpose as actual characters/colour scheme may vary.

#####Sample Character

**The font size will lie somewhere in between 250pt and 320pt.**

###Rounds

####Round 1

- In this round `n` unique numbers would be provided along with `n-1` basic operators (+ , - , x , /).
- Using an overhead camera the program has to detect all the characters present in the arena.
- The computer has to display these characters.
- The robot should traverse all these characters only once to make a logical arithmetic expression. 
- The output of this expression should be the maximum or the minimum among all the outputs generated by all possible equations. The condition of whether to generate a maximum or minimum would be disclosed before the run.
- The computer also has to display the expression and output the robot is going to generate.
- With the help of a tracker the robot has to detect its position throughout its run and traverse through these characters to form the expression displayed by the computer.
- After the expression is generated the robot has to go the end zone.
- Example: If the characters 2, 5, 6, +, x one each are placed and if the condition is to maximize the output the robot must start from start zone then traverse 5 x 6 + 2 or 6 x 5 + 2 or 2 + 5 x 6 or 2 + 6 x 5 and then finish at the end zone. So that the output is maximized to 32.
- Note that the final expression evaluated should be treated as a floating point value instead of a decimal. So the expression 2 + 5 / 4 should evaluate to 3.25

####Round 2

- In this round the number of digits and characters won't be dependent on each other.
- All the operators stated {+ ,- , / , x , ! , ( , ) , ^} except { = } may be provided in the arena.
- All the numbers should be used exactly once. Any operator should be used at most once except parenthesis. - The robot should traverse all these characters accordingly to make a logical arithmetic expression.
- The output of this expression should be the maximum or the minimum among all the outputs generated by all possible equations. The condition of whether to generate a maximum or minimum would be disclosed before the run.
- With the help of a tracker the robot has to detect its position throughout its run and traverse through these characters to form the desired equation.
- After the expression is generated the robot has to go the end zone.
- Example: The characters 2 , 5 , 1 , 3 , + , - , / , (  ,  )  , ^ are provided. Say the condition is to maximize the output. Then the robot must start from the start zone and then traverse 5 ^ ( 2 + 3 / 1) or its equivalent expressions and stop at the end zone.
- Note that the rule of a single operator between two operands doesn't hold here. For example consider the expression 5! - 2.

####Round 3

- In this round the number of digits and characters won't be dependent on each other.
- All the operators stated {+ , - , / , x , ! , ( , ) , ^} may be provided in the arena. Equality operator (=) will be definitely present.
- All the numbers should be used exactly once. Any operator should be used at most once except parenthesis and equals to. Equality operator should be used exactly once.The robot should traverse all these characters accordingly to make a logical arithmetic equation.
- The equation generated by above conditions should be arithmetically logical and support the equality operator. There are no restrictions on the number of operators/numbers on either side of the equality sign.
With the help of a tracker the robot has to detect its position throughout its run and traverse through these characters to form the desired equation.
- After the equation is generated the robot has to go the end zone.
- Example: The characters 2 , 5 , 1 , 3 , - , * , (  ,  )  , = , ^ are provided. Then the robot must start from the start zone and then traverse 5 = ( 2 * 3 ) - 1 or its equivalent equations and stop at the end zone.
