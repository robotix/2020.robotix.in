**Q: How do I register for the event?**

Registration for the events has to be done from Kshitij’s website. For the exact procedure, check www.ktj.in


**Q: Is there any abstract submission for the event?**

No abstract submission is required.


**Q: How many members can be there in a team?**

Each team can have a maximum of four members.


**Q: Will I be given time for thresholding (localization etc) before a run?**

Yes. You will be given sufficient time before a run ( ~ 20 mins) to make thresholding changes. Localization has to be done by the bot at the time of the run.


**Q: Is hard coding allowed?**

NO! We will check your codes before your run. If hard coding is detected, your run will not be considered.


**Q: Do I have to make the robot wired / wireless?**

It is your choice. Both are allowed. The bot can be controlled without a wire by Bluetooth, WiFi, XeeBee, or any other stuff but the participant has to declare what he or she will be using during the run. In case you are making a wired robot, we will be providing you with USB extendesrs.


**Q: What is the model of the onboard camera?**

Logitech HD PRO Webcam C920


**Q: How will we threshold the colours of the LED?**

You can easily create a sample image in Paint. Thresholding can also be done on a sample arena provided. It would be preferable to use trackbars so that you can easily adjust the threshold. The actual thresholding can be done on-site so as to get an accurate judgement of all the range according to the lighting condition present there.


**Q: How exactly will the video feed reach the bot?**

We will have a USB 2.0 cable of the camera which can go into your laptop’s port.


**Q: What will be the resolution of the video feed?**

We have provided the model of the camera ie. Logitech HD PRO Webcam C920.


**Q: How much time will we get between Round 1 and Round 2?**

Unfortunately, we cannot comment on that right now because it all depends on how many participants successfully complete the round. If all participants manage to complete the round within the first 6 hours, then we will give more than 24 hours to prepare for round 2 but the chances of this are highly unlikely as based on our previous experiences. But at a minimum, we will give approximately 8 hours in between. Also note, it is probable that if extremely few participants are able to complete Round 1 then there might not be a Round 2.


**Q:Will USB/programmer extenders be provided?**

Yes


**Q: Will the video feed consist of only the arena or it can have extra noise at the sides?**

It will only consist of the arena.


**Q: Can the inbuilt LED of an Arduino be used?**

No, the LED of an Arduino can’t be used as it is not visible enough to count the number of times it blinks. The LED used should be properly visible.
